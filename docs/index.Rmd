## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

### Summary Table

```{r}
source("../source/summaryinfo.R")
```


### Table 


### Chart 1 
```{r}
source("../source/chart_1")
```
This chart is a scatterplot of gdp and fertility. This scatterplot will allow us to see the correlation between gdp and fertility rates. We can use this to see whether high gdp countries are correlated with high or low fertility rates
### Chart 2
```{r}
source("../source/chart_2")
```
This chart is a barchart with the two bars being gdp and educational attainment for women. This bar chart will help us determine the correlation between how high a gdp of a country is and the educational attainment. We were able to observe that tall bars for gdp were accompanied by relatively tall bars for educational attainment. 

### Chart 3
```{r}
source("../source/chart_3")
```
This chart is a world map with mortality rates shaded. This map allows us to visually see where higher mortality rates are observable. From this we are able to see that African countries have the highest mortality rates. 


## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
