|      Abstract   | Our main question is to find out if there is a connection between a country's wealth, women's education, fertility rates, family planning, and maternal mortality rates. This question is important because our group believes there is a high correlation between a country's GDP and women's education, women's education and maternal age, and family planning and maternal mortality rates. To address the question, our group will collect the datasets regarding the main question and find the correlations in between. |

|Introduction | Women's health is an important cornerstone of the health of all people and a prerequisite and foundation for sustainable human development. It is easy to see that the problem of female abortion is still very serious, and it is a serious social problem all over the world. There are many factors that can lead to maternal related health outcomes, such as the country's GDP, income, women’s education level, etc. Whether it's less fallout from abortion or less time off work for sick leave that can help women participate in the abortion process, the reduction in abortion rates has many benefits for women themselves. leave that can help women participate in the labor market, career choices, and advancement. By reducing the rate of abortion through lower fertility rates, fewer families fall below the poverty level through fewer children in a given family. Increases in education and income can increase financial resources. This can ultimately contribute to not only individual female development, but also to national economic development. So we wanted to investigate the relationship between these factors and maternal health. |
|Problem Domain | The sociotechnical situation in which our topic falls in is framed around the overall health of women throughout the world. The UN writes that “investing in adolescent girls– especially in their education and reproductive health and rights – will ensure sustainable development for all”. From this, we are able to see that the human value of women’s rights and education highly correlates with the reproductive age of the country. Some of the direct stakeholders for the project are the adolescent girls that were unable to attain education due to family and/or financial burdens. Another group of direct stakeholders is the women in said countries. These women are the data points in the datasets we are using and so they are the ones most affected by the project. Furthermore, an additional group of direct stakeholders is the policymakers that could use the analysis being done to create and adjust policies that affect the health of women all over the world. In addition to all these direct stakeholders, there are a handful of indirect stakeholders that will be affected by our project. One group of indirect stakeholders is the families that the women come from. These families will be impacted by any policy change that results from the data. Another group of indirect stakeholders are the general public. The International Council on Women’s Health Issues writes, “The Health of Women and Girls Determines the Health and Well-Being of Our Modern World”. From this we see that the general public is effected by maternal health outcomes and therefore they are indirect stakeholders. A possible drawback from our project is that no causal claim can be made. As written in the article on causal effects of education on sexual and reproductive health in low and middle-income countries, we must understand that there are many other factors that play into the outcomes we are analyzing. An additional drawback is that women tend to have lower social status than men in most civilizations, which results in unequal power and relationships. Because of this, women are more vulnerable than men to violations of their human rights, such as sexual assault. Some benefits from this project are due to similar causes. Women are victims of gender inequality and are often ignored from discussions on a countries’ economy. Our project helps put women back into the conversation. We hope that our project will allow for people to see that maternal health is a topic to be discussed. From the project results, people will gradually realize the importance of maternal health. Then the policy makers will make feasible policies to protect and support women. https://www.un.org/youthenvoy/2016/03/education-reproductive-health-girls-key-sustainable-development/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6582211/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3703826/ |
|Research Questions | **How does a country's GDP impact women’s education?** We want to assess the correlation between how a country’s GDP can affect women’s education. Since we believe women's education is highly affected by a country’s GDP in such situations like a family is shorthanded for their farms, etc. This correlation will allow us to find reasons for lowered women’s education levels. **How does the fulfillment of family planning impact maternal mortality?** We want to assess how the percentage of women who have received family planning corresponds to mortality rates. We believe this is an important assessment to make because it will tell us a correlation that will help us answer the question of what factors lead to poor reproductive health. There is a high likelihood that lower percentages of women receiving family planning will result in higher maternal mortality, but we want to make sure of this through the data. We can also measure the extent to which it occurs. We can use the data to see the extent to which family planning matters in lowering maternal mortality rates. **How does women’s education level impact their maternal age?** A woman's level of education is closely related to her knowledge of contraception, such as contraceptive pills and devices. And there are differences in abortion rates by the women’s education level. So we hope to find the relationship between women's education and usage of contraception through the research.|
|The Dataset| We have attached the table and description at the bottom of the page|
|Expected Implications | The possible implications are that we can understand correlations between different factors that eventually lead to poor women’s health. Since women’s health is often an indicator of the health of a population, we hope that policymakers can address the largest causes of decreased women’s health. Policymakers will have the opportunity to make policy changes that allow for more women to receive an education and will also create policies to fund maternal health. Some other possible implications are that technologists can use the datasets and visualizations produced to further delve into finding correlations on a deeper level. These correlations can be used to find root causes and create infrastructures and policies that will combat these root causes. Lastly, designers could make feasible maternal-related educational resources that could be provided to women all over the world to teach them about unexpected circumstances in regard to their health and what to do in such circumstances. |
|Limitations | By using the datasets we gathered, we can find the correlations between a country's GDP and women's education, the need for family planning and maternal mortality rates, and women's education and maternal age. However, there could be a confounding variable, an unmeasured variable that influences both variables. The confounding variable could mislead the results as the variables have high correlations when it's the confounding variable that has correlations in between. Some other limitations are the causal links we can make. Since there are many other factors that influence the data, we cannot make any causal statements. We can only make statements on correlations or patterns. Furthermore, another limitation is that some of the data comes from older data and we are unable to make any assumptions about current data. Also due to some lacking data there are countries in the world that we will not be able to include in our project. This furthermore limits our ability to make assumptions.  |
|_Findings_ | In general we saw that a country's GDP does correlate with higher educational attainment. However, this cannot be generalized as were instances where low GDP countries had relatively high percentages of educational attainment. |

The first dataset is on countries GDP, this data will help us organize the most recent countries GDP. We will be able to mutate the data to compare a country's GDP with women's education levels to answer our research question. The data was collected by the World Bank throughout multiple years. The World Bank collects this data in order to keep track of a country's economic performance. The data collection effort was funded by the World Bank and they are likely to benefit from the data. The data is credible because the World Bank is the international standard for keeping track of economic data. We obtained the data from a search on the World Bank's website.

The second dataset is on the educational attainment for the population of different countries. This dataset will be beneficial because we will be able to combine this dataset (while filtering for women) to figure out how a country's GDP correlates with a women's educational level. The data was collected by Unicef. The dataset we are using comes from the years 2016 to 2021. Unicef collects this data for their mission. Funding is from voluntary contribution from governments, intergovernmental organizations, the private sector and individuals. These organizations are the ones that are gonna make money. Unicef is the global standard on data regarding women and children's health. We obtained the data from a search on Unicefs website.

The third data set is Women’s Reproductive Age. This data will help us know the married or in-union women of reproductive age who have their need for family planning. Then we can compare this data to the level of education of women for our research. The data world health statistics 2020 was collected by the World Health organization who updated it a year ago. This dataset from Kaggle covers the most recent and updated health statistics of the world. The data was funded by Kaggle website the World Health organization and they are more likely to benefit from the data. The data is secure and credible because the world health organization is the United Nations agency and they work to promote health. We obtained the data from a search on the kaggle website and we link to the world health organization.

The fourth data set is about Maternal Mortality Rates. This data can see Births attended by skilled personnel and help us compare maternal mortality at which ages, and this can be well linked to education levels. The data is collected by the World Health Organization. The purpose is to collect the information of Maternal Mortality Rates. The World Health Organization funded this data, and they are more likely to benefit from the data. The data is validated and held secure because the world health organization is the United Nations agency and their data are standard and secure. We first search on kaggle which is access to the general public and link to the data.

The fifth dataset shows the yearly fertility rate (births per woman) in each country. This dataset will enable us to answer the research questions by finding the correlations between this dataset and the datasets about a country's GDP, women's education, etc. The data is collected by the World Bank throughout decades of years from 1960 to 2020. It was collected to monitor each country's number of newborn babies every year. The World Bank borrows the money it lends to developing countries for economical improvements. The data is trustworthy since the World Bank databases' standards and norms are internationally accepted. We obtained the data from the World Bank website as it is open access to everyone.
